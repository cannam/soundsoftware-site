Redmine  Embedded
================

Plugin for Redmine to embed Doxygen/Javadoc files based on the original by Jean-Philippe Lang but updated for Redmine 2 and Rails 3

To use, create a directory for the HTML documentation and set the owner to the same user as the webserver user running your Redmine installation. Default setting is "/var/doc".

Documentation should be a zip of the root html directory, prefereably compiled without search (CSS needs some work).
