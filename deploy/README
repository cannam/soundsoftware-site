Deploying the SoundSoftware site



After deployment
----------------

There is a smoke test script at test/smoketest.sh which checks that
the home page, a project page, a repo page etc can be retrieved. Some
of the pages it tries to retrieve are dependent on their generating
cron scripts having run at least once since the server was set up.
